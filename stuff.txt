the folder logic will be entirely different and will be made after some time...


there will be a re-announce option that they can use which will reannounce thier IP aur Port...
So the node_id will uuidv4 so by reassigning they are updating the ip and port across our backend...
so uuid will be saved in a .nodeip which it will grab it each time uploading the file...

it is storing local ip so will only currently work on local network...
