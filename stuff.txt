the folder logic will be entirely different and will be made after some time...


there will be a re-announce option that they can use which will reannounce thier IP aur Port...
So the node_id will uuidv4 so by reassigning they are updating the ip and port across our backend...
so uuid will be saved in a .nodeip which it will grab it each time uploading the file...

it is storing local ip so will only currently work on local network...

in peers folder the 0.0.0.0: is hardcoreded so it will be able to listen to every ip

backend server done with curl request .^. 

file name in the peer part is being fetched by the filename given by first uploader -- will be added later

need to update the peer list after user downloads the file as the peers will increase
